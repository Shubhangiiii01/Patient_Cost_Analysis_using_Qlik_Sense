# Patient_Cost_Analysis_using_Qlik_Sense

In this case study we work for a fictional hospital which requires us to generate a dashboard for theri hospital.
Our aim is to find the overall profit, revenue, and cost. The Qlik sense app cosists of two sheets.
1. CEO sheet
2. Geo analytics sheet
3. Behaviour sheet

The CEO sheet has KPIs for Cost, Revenue, Profit, Length of stay, Average age and patient count.
The CEO sheet also uses filter panes for Gender, Age Group Drill Down and Admission Date Drill Down.
As a data analyst we have also used line graph(to calculate profitability by year) and bar graph(Practitioner Profitability) in the CEO sheet.
We have also measured the ratio of male and female patients using gauge chart.
And finally the sheet has a Patient Overview table for their activity.
